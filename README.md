# 3D Assets

Procedural 3D assets. Work in progress. Check the website at
[https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/)
for the currently available assets:
* [Drink can](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/online/drink-can.html)
* [Mug](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/online/mug.html)
* [Plate](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/online/plate.html)

#### Demo with mugs and plates

Uses [mug.js](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/docs/mug.html) and
[plate.js](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/docs/plate.html) to make a scene
of two mugs and two plates. They change radomly at irregular intervals.

Textures work well on Chromium-based browsers or browsers that support WebGPU
(at the time of writing this sentence, Firefox chokes on textures).
