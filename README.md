#### Demo with mugs and plates

Uses [mug.js](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/docs/mug.html) and
[plate.js](https://boytchev.github.io/3d-assets/docs/plate.html) to make a scene
of two mugs and two plates. They change radomly at irregular intervals.

Textures work well on Chromium-based browsers or browsers that support WebGPU
(at the time of writing this sentence, Firefox chokes on textures).
